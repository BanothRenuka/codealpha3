    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Pharmacovigilance is the science concerned with the detection, assessment,
        understanding, and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problems.
        Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) is one of the most widely used analgesic and antipyretic drugs
        worldwide. Despite its general safety at therapeutic doses, paracetamol is a leading
        cause of drug-induced liver injury when overdosed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This report analyzes the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with paracetamol,
        its mechanism of action, and measures to minimize associated risks, based on data
        reported in WHO VigiBase and DrugBank.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Mechanism of Action</h3>
    <p>
        Paracetamol acts primarily in the central nervous system. It inhibits the cyclooxygenase
        (COX) enzyme, particularly COX-2, reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in pain
        and fever.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike NSAIDs, paracetamol has minimal peripheral anti-inflammatory effects.
        It is believed to modulate serotonergic pathways and may also influence endocannabinoid
        systems contributing to analgesia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Paracetamol is metabolized in the liver. A small fraction is converted to a toxic metabolite,
        N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is detoxified by glutathione under normal conditions.
        In overdose, glutathione is depleted, leading to hepatocellular damage.

    <p>
        The most serious ADR associated with paracetamol is dose-dependent hepatotoxicity.
        WHO pharmacovigilance reports highlight overdose as a major cause of acute liver failure,
        particularly in adults with chronic alcohol use or malnutrition.

<section id="risk">
    <h3>4. Measures to Reduce Risks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adherence to recommended therapeutic doses (maximum 4 g/day in adults).</li>
        <li>Avoiding concurrent use of multiple paracetamol-containing products.</li>
        <li>Caution in patients with liver disease, alcoholism, or malnutrition.</li>
        <li>Public education on overdose risks and safe use.</li>
        <li>Early administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in cases of overdose.</li>
        <li>Clear labeling and pharmacovigilance reporting of suspected ADRs.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Paracetamol remains an effective and widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug.
        However, its potential for severe hepatotoxicity necessitates careful monitoring,
        patient education, and active pharmacovigilance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Continuous ADR reporting to databases such as WHO VigiBase plays a crucial role
        in identifying safety signals and improving drug use practices worldwide.
